## 1. House rules

Three rules sit above everything else.

1. **UI copy avoids uppercase.** Avoid `ALL-CAPS` and shouting. Prefer
   lowercase or natural sentence case where it reads better — never force
   every string to lowercase. Scope and exceptions in [§11 UI copy](#11-ui-copy).
2. **One border per edge.** Never put a border on top of a border that already
   exists. See [§10 Borders](#10-borders).
3. **Scoped edits.** Change what was asked for. Unrelated files stay untouched,
   including work already sitting dirty in the tree.

Working style: finish the task, then report the result in a few lines. No
preamble, no recaps, no process commentary. When a detail is missing, take the
reasonable default, note the assumption, and keep moving.

## 2. What this is

A single-page portfolio for Aditya Ojha (akoder.xyz) with a component showcase
at `/components` that doubles as a public shadcn registry. No backend, no
database, no auth, no payments. All content is typed configuration.

- Production: https://akoder.xyz
- Repository: github.com/AdityaKodez/adityaojha
- Deploy: Vercel, from the main branch

| `public/` | Static assets; `public/r/` holds generated registry JSON |
| `scripts/` | `build-registry.mjs` |
| `plans/` | Private planning docs, gitignored |

## 6. Data layer — the database

There is no runtime database and no server-side persistence. The "database" is
the typed config layer in `config/`: plain TypeScript objects, checked by the
compiler, imported directly by the components that need them. `config/` is the
single source of truth for content — change content there, never inline in a
component.

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `config/types.ts` | Every shared type, plus the `SectionId` union |
| `config/site.ts` | The root `siteConfig` object — meta, personal info, section order, section flags, banner, about, services, workflow, contact |
| `config/hero.ts` | `heroConfig` — hero copy |
| `config/skills.ts` | `skillsSectionConfig` + `skillsConfig` |
| `config/socials.ts` | `socialSectionConfig` + `socialsConfig` |
| `config/projects.ts` | `projectsSectionConfig` + `projectsConfig` |
| `config/experience.ts` | `experienceSectionConfig` + `experienceConfig` |
| `config/testimonials.ts` | `testimonialsConfig` |
| `config/components.ts` | `componentsSectionConfig` (home teaser), `componentRegistry` plus `findComponent()` and `getEnabledComponents()` |
| `config/registry.ts` | Registry helpers — `getAddCommands()` (namespaced `@akoder/<id>` per package manager), `getRegistrySetupSnippet()` |
| `config/world-cities.ts` | City coordinates used by the dotted world map |

Pattern to copy: every domain exports a section config object (heading text) and
a typed item array. Every item carries `id`, `order`, and an optional `enabled`
flag.

Exception: blog posts are plain markdown in `content/blogs/*.md` with YAML
frontmatter (`title`, `date`, `description`, `tags`, `draft`), loaded through
`lib/blogs.ts`. The filename is the slug (`my-post.md` → `/blog/my-post`).
`draft: true` keeps a post off the home section, the blog index, and the
sitemap, but the page still builds so the URL works as a preview. Frontmatter
never lives in `config/`.

## 7. Schema

All types live in `config/types.ts`.

- **`SiteMetaConfig`** — `url`, `title`, `titleTemplate`, `shortTitle`,
  `description`, `keywords`, `authors`, `creator`, `publisher`,
  `classification`, `category`, `locale`, `ogImage`, `twitterCreator`, `icon`,
  `appleIcon`, `googleVerification`, `manifest`, `robots`, `sitemap`.
- **`PersonalInfo`** — `fullName`, `firstName`, `avatar` (`src`, `alt`,
  `fallback`), `location` (`label`, `timezone`), `githubUsername`.
- **`HeroConfig`** — `greeting`, `waveEmoji`, `headlineBefore`,
  `highlightedPhrases`, `headlineAfter`, `description`, `descriptionHighlight`.
- **`AboutConfig`** — `title`, `body`, `emphasizedPhrases`.
- **`SkillItem`** — `id`, `name`, `icon`, `category` (`language`, `frontend`,
  `backend`, `workflow-ai`), `order`, `enabled`.
- **`SocialLink`** — `id`, `platform`, `handle`, `href`, `icon`, `order`,
  `enabled`, `action` (`copy`, `external`, `mailto`), `copyValue`,
  `shortcutKey`, `tooltipDefault`.
- **`Testimonial`** — `id`, `name`, `role`, `content`, `avatar`, `image`,
  `order`, `enabled`.
- **`Project`** — `id`, `title`, `description`, `content`, `image`, `imageAlt`,
  `liveUrl`, `githubUrl`, `year`, `status` (`building`, `new`, `shipped`),
  `category`, `tags`, `metrics` (icon `users` or `chart`, plus `label`),
  `order`, `enabled`.
- **`ExperienceItem`** — `id`, `role`, `company`, `period`, `summary`,
  `highlights`, `order`, `enabled`.
- **`Bookmark` / `Certification`** — `id`, `url`, `title`, `domain`, `date`
  (certifications only), `icon` component.
- **`ComponentDoc`** — `id`, `title`, `description`, `icon`, `demoPath`,
  `docPath`, `order`, `enabled`.
- **`ContactConfig`** — `title`, `description`, `pricing` (label, value, note),
  `channels` (reuses `SocialLink`).
- **`PortfolioConfig`** — `meta`, `personal`, `sectionOrder`, `sectionFlags`,
  `bookmarks`, `certifications`, `banner`, `about`, `services`, `workflow`,
  `contact`.

## 8. Sections and flags

The home page is a loop, not a hand-written layout.

- `app/page.tsx` maps over `siteConfig.sectionOrder` and skips any id whose
  `sectionFlags` entry is false, so reordering or hiding a section is a config
  change only.
- Every non-GitHub section has an entry in the `staticSections` map in
  `app/page.tsx`, keyed by `SectionId`.
- `github` is special: it is server-fetched, wrapped in React Suspense with
  `components/skeletons/github-skeleton.tsx`, and only rendered when
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` is present.
- The current order is projects, components, skills, about, github,
  testimonials, bookmarks, socials. Certifications, experience, services,
  workflow and contact exist but are flagged off.
- `components` is a teaser, not the showcase: it previews
  `componentsSectionConfig.previewCount` registry entries and ends in a
  `see all n components` link to `/components`. Keep it that way — the full
  catalog lives on the route, not on the home page.

To add a section:

1. Add the id to the `SectionId` union in `config/types.ts`.
2. Build the component in `components/`.
3. Register it in `staticSections` in `app/page.tsx`.
4. Add its flag and its position to `siteConfig`.

Collapsible sections use `AccordionSection` in
`components/ui/accordion-section.tsx` — it owns the heading, the expand
animation, and the dashed top rule. Do not hand-roll a second variant.

## 9. Design system

- Colors come from semantic tokens only — `background`, `foreground`, `card`,
  `popover`, `muted`, `muted-foreground`, `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`,
  `destructive`, `border`, `input`, `ring`, and `chart-1` through `chart-5`.
  They are declared as raw custom properties on `:root` and `.dark`, then
  re-exported through the `@theme inline` block in `app/globals.css`. Never
  hardcode a hex value in a component.
- Radii derive from a single `--radius` (0.45rem) as `sm`, `md`, `lg` and up.
  Use the tokens rather than literal values.
- Dark mode is class-based: `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))` plus
  `next-themes`, so `dark:` utilities follow the `.dark` class on `<html>`.
- Motion tokens live in `app/globals.css` (`--motion-duration-base`,
  `--motion-ease-standard`). Entrances are short — 0.3s with the ease
  `[0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]` — and `whileInView` fires once rather than on every
  scroll pass.
- Shared utility classes: `.section-heading`, `.micro-transition`, and the
  blueprint background used on card hover. Prefer these over repeating the
  utility stack.

## 10. Borders

This site is drawn with hairlines, and hairlines compound fast. The rule is
simple: **one border per edge, one mechanism per element.**

- The shell owns the outer frame. `<main>` in `app/page.tsx` carries
  `max-w-3xl mx-auto border-x border-b-2 overflow-x-clip`. Nothing inside it
  re-declares an outer frame or adds a vertical side rule.
- Each section owns exactly one dashed top rule (`border-t border-dashed`). If a
  parent already draws a rule on that edge, the child does not add another.
- `.section-heading` in `app/globals.css` already declares
  `border-y border-dashed`. An element using that class must not also carry
  `border-t` or `border-b`.
- Pick either `ring-1 ring-inset` or `border` — never both on the same element.
  In this codebase cards and pills use `ring-1 ring-inset`; separators use
  `border`.
- Inside `.prose`, blocks already get a radius. Do not wrap them in a second
  bordered and ringed container.
- When a new wrapper is needed, move the border to the outermost element of the
  group instead of adding one per child.
- Divider elements use the `Separator` primitive, which draws its own line. Do
  not add a `border-t` alongside it.

## 11. UI copy

**UI copy avoids uppercase.** Avoid `ALL-CAPS` and shouting. Prefer
lowercase or natural sentence case where it reads better — never force
every string to lowercase.

```tsx
// both are fine — just don't shout
const TAB_LABELS: Record<Tab, string> = {
  preview: "preview",
  code: "code",
};
// sentence case is also fine when it reads better
const EMPTY_STATE = "No activity right now.";
```

Guideline:

- tab labels, segmented controls, and collection switchers
- buttons and their state text (`copy` → `copied!` → `copy failed`)
- tooltips, `aria-label`, `alt`, and `title` attributes
- status pills and empty states
- legends (heatmap `less` / `more`)
- page and section headings rendered from code
- control labels and tooltips that live in `config/` (for example
  `themeTooltip: "toggle theme"`)

Prefer lowercase for these where it fits the design, but sentence case is
allowed when it improves readability. What to avoid is `ALL-CAPS`, `TITLE CASE`
shouting, and inconsistent casing within the same surface.

Deliberately **excluded** — leave these as authored:

- **Proper nouns and brand names.** "GitHub", "Discord", "TypeScript",
  "Next.js", "React", "Visual Studio Code", city names, people's names.
- **Editorial content in `config/`.** The about body, services, workflow
  descriptions, testimonials, bookmark titles, project copy.
- **SEO and metadata.** `meta.title`, `titleTemplate`, OG image alt text,
  `generateMetadata` output, and the JSON-LD block in `app/layout.tsx`.
- **Keyboard key identifiers.** `"ArrowRight"`, `"Home"`, `"End"` — these are
  DOM `KeyboardEvent.key` values and must match exactly.
- **Console and thrown errors.** Internal diagnostics, not user-facing copy.
- **Demo fixture data** under `app/components/[id]/demos/` — sample content that
  exists to show a component working.

## 12. Typography

- Body copy is DM Sans at 14px (`text-sm`). `text-xs` is for meta, and
  `text-base` is the largest size in normal use.
- Headings are `font-medium` with `tracking-tight`. `font-semibold` appears on a
  few section headings only; nothing is heavier than 600 anywhere.
- Mono is Geist Mono, 10–12.5px, for meta labels, keyboard hints, and code.
- Pixel accents use `font-pixel` (Geist Pixel Grid); serif accents use
  `font-serif` (Instrument Serif). Both appear sparingly.
- Section headings use the `.section-heading` class rather than ad-hoc sizes.

## 13. Markdown rendering

Three surfaces render Markdown and they must stay in sync.

| Surface | Renderer | File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Component docs at `/components/[id]` | `MarkdownAsync` from `next-mdx-remote`, server-rendered | `app/components/[id]/page.tsx` |
| Project case studies | `react-markdown`, client-rendered | `app/project/[id]/project-content.tsx` |
| Blog posts at `/blog/[slug]` | `react-markdown`, server-rendered | `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` |

- Both pass the shared override map from `components/markdown-components.tsx`.
  Never inline a second set of overrides.
- All `.prose` styling lives in one **unlayered** block of `app/globals.css`. It
  has to stay unlayered: the typography plugin registers its rules through
  `addComponents`, so `.prose` ends up layered and loses to unlayered CSS
  regardless of specificity.
- Prose colors are mapped onto project tokens (`--foreground`,
  `--muted-foreground`, `--primary`, `--border`). That makes `prose-neutral`
  and `dark:prose-invert` in markup effectively inert — do not rely on them.

## 14. Registry pipeline

The site publishes its own shadcn registry. It is JSON served over HTTP;
nothing is registered with shadcn itself.

1. `registry.json` at the root is the catalog — name `akoder`, homepage
   akoder.xyz, and an `items` array. Each item declares `name`, `type`,
   `title`, `description`, `dependencies` (npm packages),
   `registryDependencies` (shadcn items such as `tooltip`), `files`, and a
   `docs` string.
2. `scripts/build-registry.mjs` reads the catalog, inlines each file's source,
   and writes `public/r/registry.json` plus one `public/r/<name>.json` per
   item. It runs on `prebuild`, so Vercel always ships fresh JSON.
3. Consumers register the `@akoder` namespace in their `components.json` and
   install with `npx shadcn add @akoder/<name>`. The direct
   `https://akoder.xyz/r/<name>.json` URL still works without setup.

Rules:

- Any edit to a file listed in `registry.json` must be followed by
  `npm run registry:build`, or the published JSON goes stale.
- Published files must be self-contained. A consumer's project has no `config/`
  directory, no `@/config/*` imports, and no site-specific data. Inline data or
  accept it as props.
- Self-containment wins over the §9 token rule: published files may inline
  literal colors (hex/oklch) or use `var(--token, literal-fallback)` so they
  still render in projects that lack this site's tokens. Site-internal
  components still follow §9.
- Keep UI copy inside published components lowercase too where it fits — it is part of the
  design language consumers are installing. Avoid uppercase shouting there as well.
- Current items: dotted-world-map, copy-command-block, github-map,
  project-explorer, progressive-blur, infinite-slider, carousel, mode-toggler,
  interactive-skill-cloud, contact-channels.

## 15. Component showcase

- `config/components.ts` holds `componentRegistry` plus two helpers:
  `findComponent(id)` skips disabled entries, and `getEnabledComponents()`
  returns enabled entries sorted by `order`.
- Each entry points at a live demo under `app/components/[id]/demos/` and a
  Markdown doc under `content/components/`.
- `getComponentIcon(name)` in `components/component-icons.tsx` maps an
  `icon` key onto its icon component. Both the showcase and the home teaser use
  it — do not write a second switch.
- Set `enabled: false` to hide an entry without deleting it.
- To add a component: write the doc file, write the demo file, add the catalog
  entry, and — if it should be installable — add the file to `registry.json`.

## 16. Environment

| Variable | Used by | Behaviour when missing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `lib/github.ts`, `app/page.tsx` | The GitHub section is skipped entirely — by design, not a bug |
| `DISCORD_USER_ID` | `app/api/discord-status/route.ts` | Falls back to a hardcoded user id |

Gotchas:

- A dev server is normally already running on http://localhost:3000. Starting a
  second one fails with "Another next dev server is already running" — reuse
  the existing one rather than switching ports.
- `next build` cannot run in the sandbox: Turbopack's cleanup of
  `.next/turbopack` trips the bulk-delete guard. Validate with
  `npx tsc --noEmit` and the dev server instead.
- `var(--font-mono)` does not work in hand-written CSS. `@theme inline` makes
  Tailwind inline the value instead of emitting the variable, so use the
  `font-mono` utility or `var(--font-geist-mono)`.
- `plans/` is gitignored and is not part of the shipped site.

## 17. Definition of done

1. `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. `npm run lint`
3. `npm run registry:build` if any file referenced by `registry.json` changed
4. Check the result in the dev server on http://localhost:3000
5. Update this file if a convention changed
